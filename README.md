## Hi thereðŸ‘‹

# My name is Mariangel, I'm from Argentina.

About me: Two years ago, I decided to make a career change. After learning to code with Javascript, I was very excited and didn't want to stop and that's why  I decided to dabble in IT because I wanted to keep learning, challenge myself, and improve my lifestyle. **I think it's the best decision that i have ever made.**

## Skills

I have experience in gastronomy and customer service, which has given me certain qualities such as **patience, kindness, _teamwork_, and _leadership_.**

## Lenguages and tools:
Jvascript | Node.js | Express | MySQL | PostgreSQL | Sequelize | React  |  Redux | JWT  | Passport | Testing | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap
